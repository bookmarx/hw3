# HW5 - Phase 3

[ ![Codeship Status for bookmarx/hw3](https://codeship.com/projects/30b9c5e0-029a-0134-086d-663251dd2b3e/status?branch=master)](https://codeship.com/projects/153629)

### Phase

Phase 1 branch: master-phase-1

Phase 2 branch: master-phase-2

Phase 3 branch: master/master-phase-3

###Module Building

Using webpack: https://webpack.github.io/

###App Structure
```
/client            -- Generated by webpack, client-side app
    index.html     -- Only file not generated by webpack
/client-webpack    -- Webpack files compiled for client

/server    -- The server-side app
   /api_v1 -- Version 1 of our API, contains each api as a subdirectory
      /bookmark                 -- API for bookmark
         bookmark.controller.js -- Controller Logic
         index.js               -- Routing
      /user                     -- API for user
         user.controller.js
         user.model.js
         index.js
    /auth        -- Authentication Library
       /local    -- Local Authentication Strategy
       auth.js   -- Main Authentication Logic
       index.js  -- Authentication Routing
    /config      -- App Configurations
       /environment -- Environment Specific Configurations (i.e. production, development, stage)
       express.js   -- Express Configurations
    /views       -- EJS Templates
       /partials -- EJS Partials
    app.js       -- Main App
    db.js        -- DB Setup
    logger.js    -- Logger Util

    Procfile     -- Heroku settings
    bower.json   -- Bower Dependencies
    package.json -- Node Dependencies
    gulpfile.js  -- Dev/Build Tools

```

### Notable Features

1) Strong password security hashedPassword w/ random salt
1) Token using JSON Web Tokens to validate api calls and securely transport some non-vital user data.
1) Forget password with One Time Token Password reset send via NodeMailer
1) Webpack minification, optimization, custom font building reduced size from 130kb uncompressed down to < 20kb compressed
1) Webpack compiles node like module in `client-webpack` loading system for scalablity and easy maintainability
1) Good project structure, single view folder shared between client-webpack and server
1) CodeShip Continuous Integration and Deployment (heroku) with 1 unit tests

### Things that didn't make it into the build

1) Linter
1) Pagination is done, but not enough time to tests and merge
1) Service Workers
1) Note enough time to tests for all error cases
